# Simple Calculator Built with Python and Tkinter

I have developed a lightweight, fully functional calculator application using Python's standard GUI library, Tkinter. This project demonstrates the practical use of GUI programming to create an intuitive and user-friendly tool for basic arithmetic.

## key features:
* Basic Arithmetic Operations:Performs the four fundamental mathematical operations:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Divisionn (/)

* Interactive Display: A clean, single-line display (Entry widget) shows the current input and the final result of calculations.

* Input Management:

1. Backspace (⌫): Allows users to delete the last entered digit or operator, making it easy to correct mistakes without starting over.

2. Clear (C): Completely resets the calculator's display and state, providing a fresh start for a new calculation.
